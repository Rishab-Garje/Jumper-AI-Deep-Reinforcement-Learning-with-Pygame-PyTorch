# Jumper AI: Deep Reinforcement Learning with Pygame & PyTorch  

Jumper AI is a reinforcement learning project where an agent learns to jump over obstacles in a 2D side-scrolling environment using Deep Q-Networks (DQN). The environment is built with Pygame, and training is implemented using PyTorch.  

## 🚀 Features  

- **Grid-based 2D Environment** – A simple 20x1 grid with scalable rendering.  
- **Physics-Based Movement** – Gravity and jumping mechanics for a realistic feel.  
- **Randomized Obstacles** – AI must learn to avoid obstacles dynamically.  
- **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** – Uses a neural network to approximate Q-values.  
- **Epsilon-Greedy Strategy** – Balances exploration and exploitation.  
- **Replay Memory** – Experience replay for stable training.  
- **Training Visualization** – Score progression plotted with Matplotlib.
